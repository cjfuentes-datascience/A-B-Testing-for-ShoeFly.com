# A-B Testing for ShoeFly.com

This project is intended to analyze two different versions of an ad, which they have placed in emails, as well as in banner ads on Facebook, Twitter, and Google. They want to know how the two ads are performing on each of the different platforms on each day of the week. We will them analyze the data using aggregate measures.


The file we will be analyzing is a csv file called "ad_clicks.csv".

Next up is our code that we wrote to analyze both the ad sources and A/B tests from ShoeFly.com. 

The purpose of this exercise is to utilize the pandas library within python.
